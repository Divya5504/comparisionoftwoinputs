I probably wouldn't use a map function but rather some Decision logic in the process flow. Of course there will likely be a number of considerations based on the specifics of your use case but I might think of approaching it like this. I'm going to assume each document contains multiple records (like a CSV or "bulk" XML).

Take the second document and store it in a Document Cache. Be sure to split (using a Data Process - Split shape) so that each record is indexed separately. (Docs need to go into the cache at the granularity with which you want to look them up.)
Split the first document again by record.
Use a Decision shape to take some identifying value from the data and do a Document Cache lookup and check for a result.
If "true", simply ignore it by routing to a Stop shape.
If "false", continue processing as necessary, perhaps using a Data Process - Combine shape to re-combine the records into a single document.

Conceptually it might look like this:
